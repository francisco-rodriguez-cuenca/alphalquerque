# alphalquerque

The application of AlphaZero to the game Alquerque de Doce

Based on the simplified, highly flexible, commented and (hopefully) easy to understand implementation of self-play based reinforcement learning based on the AlphaGo Zero paper (Silver et al) developed by Surag Nair on https://github.com/suragnair/alpha-zero-general. An accompanying tutorial can be found [here](http://web.stanford.edu/~surag/posts/alphazero.html). 

The implementation of Alquerque has been influenced by the OthelloGame implementation by Surag Nair and the tictacToe implementation by Evgeny Tyurin.
